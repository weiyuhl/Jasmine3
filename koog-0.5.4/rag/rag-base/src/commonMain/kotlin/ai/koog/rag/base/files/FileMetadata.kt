         *
         * Features:
         * - Encapsulates information and behavior specific to directories.
         * - Used in conjunction with other classes (e.g., `FileSystemProvider`) for file system management.
         *
         * Considerations:
         * - Instances of `Directory` are not directly concerned with file contents
         *   but with structure and navigation within the file system.
         * - The class may be utilized for tasks like directory traversal,
         *   metadata analysis, or adopting domain-specific implementations.
