# Module agents-features-a2a-client

Agent feature for enabling A2A client capabilities within Koog agents.

## Overview

This module provides an agent feature that enables Koog agents to act as A2A clients, allowing them to communicate with remote A2A-enabled agents. When installed, agents gain access to a registry of A2A clients and pre-built nodes for sending messages, managing tasks, and subscribing to events from other A2A agents.

## Key Components

- **`A2AAgentClient`**: Feature providing access to registered A2A clients from agent nodes
- **Agent Nodes**: Pre-built nodes for common operations (messaging, task management, push notifications)
