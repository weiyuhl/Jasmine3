/**
 * Abstract base class representing a single-use AI agent with state.
 *
 * This AI agent is designed to execute a specific long-running strategy only once, and provides API to monitor and manage it's state.
 *
 * It maintains internal states including its running status, whether it was started, its result (if available), and
 * the root context associated with its execution. The class enforces safe state transitions and provides
 * thread-safe operations via a mutex.
 *
 * @param Input the type of the input accepted by the agent.
 * @param Output the type of the output produced by the agent.
 * @param TContext the type of the context used during the agent's execution, extending [AIAgentContext].
 * @property logger the logger used for logging execution details and errors.
 * @param id the unique identifier for the agent. Random UUID will be generated if set to null.
