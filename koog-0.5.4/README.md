## Overview

Koog is a Kotlin-based framework designed to build and run AI agents entirely in idiomatic Kotlin. It lets you create agents that can interact with tools, handle complex workflows, and communicate with users.

### Key features

Key features of Koog include:

- **Multiplatform development**: Deploy agents across JVM, JS, WasmJS, Android, and iOS targets using Kotlin Multiplatform.
- **Reliability and fault-tolerance**: Handle failures with built-in retries and restore the agent state at specific points during execution with the agent persistence feature.
- **Intelligent history compression**: Optimize token usage while maintaining context in long-running conversations using advanced built-in history compression techniques.
- **Enterprise-ready integrations**: Utilize integration with popular JVM frameworks such as Spring Boot and Ktor to embed Koog into your applications.
- **Observability with OpenTelemetry exporters**: Monitor and debug applications with built-in support for popular observability providers (W&B Weave, Langfuse).
- **LLM switching and seamless history adaptation**: Switch to a different LLM at any point without losing the existing conversation history, or reroute between multiple LLM providers.
- **Integration with JVM and Kotlin applications**: Build AI agents with an idiomatic, type-safe Kotlin DSL designed specifically for JVM and Kotlin developers.
- **Model Context Protocol integration**: Use Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools in AI agents.
- **Knowledge retrieval and memory**: Retain and retrieve knowledge across conversations using vector embeddings, ranked document storage, and shared agent memory.
- **Powerful Streaming API**: Process responses in real-time with streaming support and parallel tool calls.
- **Modular feature system**: Customize agent capabilities through a composable architecture.
- **Flexible graph workflows**: Design complex agent behaviors using intuitive graph-based workflows.
- **Custom tool creation**: Enhance your agents with tools that access external systems and APIs.
- **Comprehensive tracing**: Debug and monitor agent execution with detailed, configurable tracing.

### Available LLM providers and platforms

The LLM providers and platforms whose LLMs you can use to power your agent capabilities:

- Google
- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- DeepSeek
- OpenRouter
- Ollama
- Bedrock

### Quickstart example

To help you get started with AI agents, here is a quick example:

```kotlin
fun main() = runBlocking {
    // Before you run the example, assign a corresponding API key as an environment variable.
   val apiKey = System.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") // or Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter, etc.

   val agent = AIAgent(
      executor = simpleOpenAIExecutor(apiKey), // or Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter, etc.
      systemPrompt = "You are a helpful assistant. Answer user questions concisely.",
      llmModel = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o
   )

   val result = agent.run("Hello! How can you help me?")
   println(result)
}
```

## Using in your projects

### Supported targets

Currently, the framework supports the JVM, JS, WasmJS and iOS targets.

### Requirements

- JDK 17 or higher is required to use the framework on JVM.
- kotlinx-coroutines 1.10.2 and kotlinx-serialization 1.8.1 versions should be set explicitly in existing projects. Please check the [libs.versions.toml](gradle/libs.versions.toml) to know more about the Koog dependencies.

### Gradle (Kotlin DSL)

1. Add dependencies to the `build.gradle.kts` file:

    ```
    dependencies {
        implementation("ai.koog:koog-agents:0.5.4")
    }
    ```
2. Make sure that you have `mavenCentral()` in the list of repositories.
### Gradle (Groovy)

1. Add dependencies to the `build.gradle` file:

    ```
    dependencies {
        implementation 'ai.koog:koog-agents:0.5.4'
    }
    ```
2. Make sure that you have `mavenCentral()` in the list of repositories.
### Maven

1. Add dependencies to the `pom.xml` file:

    ```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>ai.koog</groupId>
        <artifactId>koog-agents-jvm</artifactId>
        <version>0.5.4</version>
    </dependency>
    ```
2. Make sure that you have `mavenCentral` in the list of repositories.
